A comparison of Classical Analytical Techniques versus Modern Data Science Techniques in the forecasting of oil well production over the lifetime of the well. 

In this paper I detail various methods of analyzing oil well production using a combination of both machine learning algorithms and modern analysis techniques. My findings show that using these techniques produces results over an order of magnitude greater than classiscal analysis techniques (2.5%-5% vs. 20%-30% accuracy).

I intend on increasing this research to include the domain of multiple enhanced oil recovery recovery units over an entire field in the multivariate analysis section, with an attempt to expand into the domain of predicting new wells drilled.
