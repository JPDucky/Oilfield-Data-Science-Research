README:
    1. Injprodedit.py – This is my data cleaning code
        a. Put the file location into line 13
        b. Choose the column names in line 16
        c. Pick the index column in line 17
        d. Line 19 drops Nan values
        e. Line 25 saves the file to a .CSV
    2. Eda project1.py – This is my exploratory data analysis code
        a. Line 19 sets the data frame to import a chosen csv file
        b. Lines 24-29 when uncommented plot the distributions of the chosen variables
        c. Lines 46-49 when uncommented do a pair plot
        d. Lines 64-67 create a correlation plot between chosen variables
    3. VAR2.py – This is my vector autoregression file
        a. Lines 40-44 import the data and set the dataframe
        b. Lines 61-62 import the model
        c. Lines 66-71 run the model and print the values
    4. Lstm injprod.py – this is my univariate lstm
        a. Lines 20-42 convert the data into a format readable by the algorithm
        b. Lines 45-46 import the data
        c. Lines 48-49 encode any categorical data into numerical values
        d. Lines 53-54 normalize the data
        e. Lines 61-71 shape the data for the machine and split it into test and training sets
        f. Lines 75-85 run the lstm
        g. Lines 88-98 print the forecast
    5. Multivlstm without lag (red river b).py – this is my multivariate lstm
        a. Lines 20-42 convert the data into a readable format for the algorithm
        b. 60-62 imports the data
        c. Line 66 stops the array at 374
        d. Lines 83-84 scale the data and normalize it
        e. 105-107 splits it into test and train sets
        f. 133 inputs the amount of nodes that run in the machine
        g. 140-152 define and fit the lstm
        h. 188-215 un shape, un scale, and unnormalize the data then print it, something is causing an error
    6. Multivlstm stock.py – this was the code that I got to print the production curve
        a. Everything is the same as above, except after ‘print rmse’:
        b. Lines 178-180 add the padding matrix to the plot
        c. Line 185 concatenates the matrices to be plotted
        d. 188-196 plots the data
